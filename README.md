# Terminal Gpt

## Description

This project demonstrates how to use the `ai.py` module along with OpenAI's API to interact with GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 Turbo) for natural language processing tasks.

## Setup

To run the code in this repository, you need to set up your OpenAI API credentials. Follow these steps:

1. Sign up for the GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 Turbo) waitlist at [https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api](https://openai.com/waitlist/gpt-4-api)
2. Once you get access to the API, you will receive an API key. Replace `"your-key-here"` in the code below with your API key.
## Contents

- `ai.py`: The main Python module that encapsulates the AI logic for interacting with the GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 Turbo) chat model.
- `gpt.py`: An example Python script demonstrating how to use the `ai.py` module to interact with the AI.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/my-awesome-ai-project.git`
2. Install the required dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Set up your OpenAI API credentials as explained in the "Setup" section.
4. Run the example script: `python gpt.py`

## Note

This code is designed to work with GPT-4 (or GPT-3.5 Turbo) models. If you don't have access to these models, the code will automatically revert to using the `gpt-3.5-turbo` model.
